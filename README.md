# LeetCodeAlgorithm
AlgorithmProblem  
problem 1.Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.  
problem 2.Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

 Valid Parentheses   
 Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.    
     
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters    
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.   

Median of Two Sorted Arrays   
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

Divide Two Integers   
Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.
   
Maximum Subarray
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
