# LeetCodeAlgorithm
AlgorithmProblem  
problem 1.Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.  
problem 2.Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

 Valid Parentheses   
 Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.    
     
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters    
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.   

Median of Two Sorted Arrays   
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

Divide Two Integers   
Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.
   
Maximum Subarray   
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

ZigZag Conversion   
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows

String to Integer (atoi)   
Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.   

Regular Expression Matching   
Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.    

Container With Most Water   
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.   

Integer to Roman   
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.
